                        revolutionized the tech industry with its software products, particularly the Windows operating system. <br> <br>

                        Gates served as Microsoft's CEO until 2000 and remained active in its management until stepping down as chairman <br>

                        focuses on global health, education, and poverty alleviation. <br><br>
                        
                        Throughout his career, Gates has been recognized as one of the world's wealthiest individuals. His contributions to <br>
